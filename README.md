This is a project inspired by other Traffic Monitoring apps and I tried to develop one my way. It is based on a client-server communication where the clients send different requests to server and the server process them. It works only in terminal because I didnt develop any graphic interface.
My app has the next functionalities:
-Log in the app based on your location.
-See the speed limitations applied on the road you are.
-Can choose to get updates about weather, news or fuel prices.
-Report incidents and provide informations about them.
